**Hi**, I'm Zhi Yan, a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at Rice University, advised by Prof. Luay Nakhleh. My research interests lie in the area of computational biology, particularly in methods for evolutionary analysis in the presence of ILS, duplication, loss, and reticulation.\n I like to spend my spare time cooking and playing badminton.
