**Hi**, I'm Zhi Yan, a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at Rice University, advised by Prof. [Luay Nakhleh](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/). My research interests lie in the area of computational biology, particularly in methods for evolutionary analysis in the presence of ILS, duplication, loss, and reticulation.<br/>
I like to spend my spare time cooking and playing badminton.
